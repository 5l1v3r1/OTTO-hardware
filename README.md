Hardware prototype for the OTTO Synthetizer 

Use Kicad to open the project

The main features are (for now):
**50 key button matrix** 
**4 clickable color coded encoders**
**1W Audio amplifier** for the internal speaker
**Battery management and charging** circuit for the lipo/li-ion batteries and a led battery meter  
**Gpio breakout** to allow to position the Raspberry rotated 90 degrees to access the USB ports and to easely use both the LCD screen and the audio card.
